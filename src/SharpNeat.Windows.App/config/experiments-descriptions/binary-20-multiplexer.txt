Binary 20-Multiplexer Task.

A neural net has 20 inputs, four are address inputs, and 16 are data inputs. All of the inputs accept a binary value (zero or one).

There is a single output.

A binary address is presented to the four address inputs, and this indicates which of the sixteen data input values are to be selected for the output.

Evaluation consists of looping through the 16 addresses, and for each one evaluating the network against a series of 128 test patterns on the data inputs, giving a total of 2,048 test cases per evaluation. For each evaluation, the output value must match the value being presented to the data input selected by the address inputs.

An output less than 0.5 is considered a binary 0 response, and >=0.5 a binary 1. However, fitness at each evaluation is on a continuous scale, and these are summed across all evaluations to give a maximum possible fitness of 16 * 128 = 2,048.

Unlike for binary-11 and binary-6 multiplexer problems, the test inputs are not exhaustively evaluated with every possible input combination, due to the large number of combinations (2^20 = 1,048,576).
