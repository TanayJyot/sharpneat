Binary 11-Multiplexer Task.

A neural net has 11 inputs, three are address inputs, and eight are data inputs. All of the inputs accept a binary value (zero or one).

There is a single output.

A binary address is presented to the three address inputs, and this indicates which of the eight data inputs values are to be selected for the output.

Evaluation consists of exhaustively evaluating the network against each of the 2048 (2^11) possible input combinations. For each evaluation, the output value must match the value being presented to the data input selected by the address inputs.

An output less than 0.5 is considered a binary 0 response, and >=0.5 a binary 1. However, fitness at each evaluation is on a continuous scale, and these are summed across all evaluations to give a maximum possible fitness of 2048.
